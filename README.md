## Explore US Bikeshare Data

### July 10th, 2023

### Overview
This project makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” _Chicago_, _New York City_, and _Washington_. The project is done as part of Udacity's **Programming for Data Science with Python** course and tests skills in numpy and pandas libraries (along with the standard Python libraries like datetime).

### An interactive experience
The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the subset of the data for which answers are computed will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which the data is analyzed.

### Statistics Computed
The statistics that are computed are:
* Popular times of travel
  * most common month
  * most common day of week
  * most common hour of day
* Popular stations and trip
  * most common start station
  * most common end station
  * most common trip from start to end
* Trip duration
  * total travel time
  * average travel time
* User info
  * counts of each user type
  * counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  * earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

 The script also prompts the user whether they would want to see the raw data.
